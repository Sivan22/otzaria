/// The `Data` class represents an abstract layer for handling the app's data.

/// The `metadata` field is a map, where the keys are book titles and the values are maps,
/// where the keys are metadata fields and the values are their corresponding values.

/// The `getLibrary` method returns a [Library] object, which represents the library.
/// The `getBookText` method returns a [Future] that resolves to a [String],
/// which contains the text of the book with the given title.
/// The `getBookToc` method returns a [Future] that resolves to a [List] of [TocEntry] objects,
/// which represent the table of contents of the book with the given title.
/// The `getAllLinksForBook` method returns a [Future] that resolves to a [List] of [Link] objects,
/// which represent the links for the book with the given title.
/// The `getLinkContent` method returns a [Future] that resolves to a [String],
/// which contains the content of the link.
