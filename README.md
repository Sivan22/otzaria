<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![alt text](image.png)

I felt the lack of an open source app of the jewish library, for PCs.


Torat Ememt is old and no longer maintained, and Sefaria's app is great, however, it does not work well on computers.

So i decided to make one myself. I did not know Dart and Flutter at all in the beginning, but it was fun. I **love** to learn new technologies!

The database itself is accessible to everyone following the important work of the Sefaria organization, so a big thank to them for that.

Key features of the project:
* the software is FREE and will be ALLWAYS FREE.
* Built to work effeciently on any device, including Windows, Linux, and Android.
* The app is designed to be as user friendly as possible.
* A thorough selection process has been undertaken to ensure that the books are suitable for the Torah community
* the library is flexible, means that you can add or remove books from the library.
* fast search engine, including the user-added books.
* the app supports the following formats: TXT, Docx and PDF.

I hope that my work will help the Torah community to learn easiely and effectively anytime and anywhere.

### Built With



* [![Dart][dart]][Dart-url]
* [![Flutter][Flutter]][Flutter-url]

I Choose to use Dart and Flutter. I think that is the most efficient and most modern way to build a GUI app.

Also, it is a multiplatform framework.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

the app is still in development. so there is no installation package yet. you can download the zip from the GitHub repo, unzip it, and run the app.

### Prerequisites

#### windows
make sure that Visual C++ Redistributable is installed on your computer. if not download it from [Here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170) and install it.


### Installation

#### windows and linux
* download the full zip (including the library) from the releases page, unzip it, and run the app.
* when first running the app, provide the path to the library. the path should be inside the unzipped folder.

#### android

* Download the apk from the releases page, and install it.
* download the library from the releases page, and unzip it on your device.
* when first running the app, provide the path to the library. the path should be inside the unzipped folder.
